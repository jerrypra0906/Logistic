Project Title: KPN Logistics Intelligence Platform (KLIP)
Product Manager: Jerry Pratama
Date: [Insert Date]
 
1. Product Overview
The KPN Logistics Intelligence Platform (KLIP) is a centralized, web-based solution 
designed to digitalize logistics data management, automate tracking, and enable real-time 
visibility across Trading, Logistics Operations, and Admin Support teams. 
It eliminates manual spreadsheet processes and fragmented SAP exports by integrating 
SAP logistics data into a unified platform equipped with analytics dashboards, AI insights, 
and smart workflow automation.
 
2. Problem Statement
Current logistics tracking relies heavily on manual data extraction from SAP into Excel. 
This creates:
*	Data duplication and inconsistent records.
*	Slow and error-prone reporting.
*	Limited visibility for management to track performance, gain/loss, and delivery 
SLAs.
*	No predictive insights or automated alerts.
Without transformation, KPN risks inefficient coordination, decision delay, and financial 
leakage due to manual reconciliation errors.
 
3. Objectives
*	Provide real-time logistics data visibility across contracts, shipments, and 
deliveries.
*	Enable automated integration with SAP for daily data refresh.
*	Build custom dashboards and KPIs for management visibility.
*	Leverage AI to generate operational insights, risk alerts, and recommendations.
*	Support multi-role access (Trading, Logistics Ops, Admin, Finance, 
Management) with appropriate data visibility.
 
4. Scope
In-Scope
*	Integration with SAP logistics, trading, and finance tables.
*	Web-based data management and visualization platform.
*	Role-based access control and approval workflows.
*	Automated data refresh (daily at 7:00 AM).
*	AI-driven dashboards and insights.
*	KPI and variance reporting (e.g., Gain/Loss, Quantity Deviation, SLA).
*	Export-to-Excel functionality for auditors and admins.
Out-of-Scope
*	SAP backend changes or data model redesign.
*	Operational KPI calculation beyond defined contract metrics.
